                <h3>How to Play</h3>
                <p>DraftSim takes a given collection of cards and allows you to simulate draft and sealed games with it. To play, first create or import a collection. Next, select the format you wish to simulate.</p>
                <h3>Using the Collection Builder</h3>
                <p>The Collection Builder helps you create the starting card pool. You can search for existing cards by name, filtering the results by set, rarity, color, and more! Just click a card to add it to the collection (up to 4 copies). Once you have at least [TODO figure out minimum collection size] cards in the collection, you're ready to play!</p>
